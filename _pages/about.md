<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a first-year PhD student in the Electrical and
Computer Engineering Department at Cornell Tech, advised by
Professor Udit Gupta.

My research focuses on designing energy-efficient computing systems from a full-stack perspective, spanning
compiler optimization to embedded edge platforms. 

I develop models and tools to understand the relationships
between performance, energy use, and environmental impact, and explore hardware–software co-design strategies
that improve efficiency across the system stack. 

Much of my recent work looks at edge devices, where I study how
design choices affect both system performance and long-term sustainability.
