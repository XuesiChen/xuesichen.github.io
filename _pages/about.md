I am a first-year PhD student in the Electrical and
Computer Engineering Department at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), advised by
Professor [Udit Gupta](https://ugupta.com/index.html).

My research focuses on designing energy-efficient computing systems from a full-stack perspective, spanning
compiler optimization to embedded edge platforms. I develop models and tools to understand the relationships
between performance, energy use, and environmental impact, and explore hardware–software co-design strategies
that improve efficiency across the system stack. Much of my recent work looks at edge devices, where I study how
design choices affect both system performance and long-term sustainability.

Prior to joining Cornell Tech, I received my MS from Carnegie Mellon University, 
where I focused on energy-efficient dataflow architecture design for coarse-grained 
reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) under the supervision of 
[Nathan Beckmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~beckmann/) and [Brandon Lucia](https://brandonlucia.com/).
As an undergraduate at Tufts University, I researched cache contention 
and CPU performance modeling, advised by [Mark Hempstead](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/people/prof-hempstead/).
